            <h2>What is Biryani ?</h2>
            <p>
                Biryani is a staple meal in many homes for special occasions and holidays. It's the epitome of
                Indian comfort food, one that elevates humble ingredients into a showstopping dish that's a favorite
                across the Indian subcontinent.
                With countless regional variations, what I love most about biryani is that it is a blank canvas of
                sorts,
                allowing you to pick your protein choice or keep it vegetarian.
                Come learn about the origin and process of making this popular layered rice dish. With a little bit
                of
                know-how and the right set of ingredients, this dish can become a staple in your home too.<br></p>
            <p><strong>Biryani</strong> (pronounced 'beer-ya-nee'), in its most fundamental form, is a layered rice
                dish
                made with
                Indian spices, rice, fresh herbs, and usually some type of protein, such as meat, cheese, or egg.
                It is traditionally assembled in a clay pot, sealed with dough, and cooked for hours over a low
                flame.

            <h2>Components of Biryani</h2>
            <h3> A typical recipe contains four main ingredients: rice, meat, marinade, and spices.
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rice:</strong> long grain aromatic white rice, such as basmati, is the most popular. But
                    there are additional
                    options, which we touch on below.</li>
                <li><strong>Meat:</strong> regional variations exist based on the protein source that is easily
                    available. Shrimp and
                    seafood are more common in coastal regions, whereas meat (chicken, lamb, mutton, goat, beef) is
                    used
                    in the inland regions.</li>
                <li><strong>Marinade: </strong> a yogurt-spiced marinade is a classic approach, as the yogurt helps
                    tenderize the meat prior to cooking. That being said, variations exist among regions.</li>
                <li> <strong>Spices:</strong> spices are added during the cooking process to add as much flavor as
                    possible. The spices can be whole or ground, and vary with each version.
                    Commonly used spiced include cumin, coriander, and garam masala.</li>
                <li> <strong>Aromatics:</strong> this includes soaked saffron, fresh herbs, whole spices, fresh
                    ginger,
                    and garlic. This further adds to the depth of the dish.</li>
                <li><strong>Fried Onions: </strong>caramelized onions are usually added on top of the rice before
                    steam
                    cooking, along with nuts and herbs.</li>
                <li> <strong>For Vegetarian Biryani:</strong> Paneer, eggs, potato, and assorted vegetables are
                    popular
                    choices for meatless biryani.</li>
