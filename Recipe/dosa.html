            <h2>What is Dosa ?</h2>
            <p>Dosa also called as Dosai (in Tamil language) is a famous and popular South Indian breakfast or snack in
                India as well in the rest of the world. Dosa are basically crispy or soft crepes made with ground and
                fermented lentil and rice batter.</p>
            <p>To make the batter, first the lentils and rice are soaked in water for 4 to 5 hours. They are then ground
                separately to a fine consistency.</p>

            <p>Then both the lentil batter and the rice batter are mixed with salt in a wide bowl or pan. This batter is
                then allowed to ferment overnight or for 8 to 9 hours.
            </p>
            <p>After the batter is fermented, it increases in volume, has a pleasant fermented aroma and a slightly sour
                taste. A well-fermented batter makes the best dosa. You will also see many tiny air-pockets in the
                batter.</p>
            <p>The fermented batter is poured on a seasoned cast-iron pan or skillet (tawa) and spread like a pancake
                and cooked till crispy and golden with a drizzle of oil or ghee.</p>
